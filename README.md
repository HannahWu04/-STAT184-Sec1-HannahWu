 STAT184 Github Day 1 HW Template
 
## Introduction
This repository was created as part of an exercise to practice using GitHub repositories. The goal was to understand the basic functionality of version control and practice adding files, organizing folders, and using Git to track changes. 

## Implementation
1. Creating a new repository on GitHub and cloning it to my local machine using GitHub Desktop.
2. Set up the folder structure, which includes a data folder for the raw data and a code folder for scripts.
3. Added day3_ws.qmd file to the code folder.
4. Added global_climate_indicators_raw.csv to the data folder.
5. Added a .gitignore file to the repository to the global_climate_indicators_raw.csv file.
6. A metadata file was created to provide a brief description of the data folder, listing the files it contains and their purpose.

## Results or Conclusion
This exercise allowed me to practice the basics of using GitHub, including:
1. Creating and organizing a repository
2. Using .gitignore
3. Using metadata file to provide a description 
4. Committing and pushing changes
